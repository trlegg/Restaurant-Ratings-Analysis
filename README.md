## Key Insights Summary
- Service quality (1.09) is significantly lower than food quality (1.22), suggesting service improvement is the main opportunity for restaurants.
- Restaurants offering Wine & Beer receive higher customer ratings.
- Customer base is dominated by young students with medium budgets.
- Restaurant price levels show limited influence on ratings.
- A small group of restaurants consistently achieves outstanding ratings, indicating strong operational performance.

## Future Enhancements:
- **Operational Strategy**: Do not waste capital on real estate with large parking lots. Instead, prioritize securing a liquor license (specifically for Wine & Beer) to increase ancillary revenue and elevate the perceived dining experience.
- **Competitive Advantage**: Invest heavily in customer service training. Because the overall market is being dragged down by poor service scores (1.09), a budget-friendly restaurant that consistently delivers fast, friendly service will immediately stand out and easily capture market share.
